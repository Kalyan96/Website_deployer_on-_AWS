# EVGarage


### **Technical Overview of the Project**
This project involves the phased deployment of a robust web application, demonstrating a complete DevOps pipeline, including infrastructure provisioning, container orchestration, and automation. Key highlights include:

1. **End-to-End Application Deployment:**
   - **Node.js Application with Backend Database:** The project deploys a Node.js-based web application connected to a backend database, ensuring proper communication and reliability between components.
   - **Containerized Deployment:** The entire application stack is containerized using Docker, facilitating portability, scalability, and environment consistency.

2. **Cloud Infrastructure Management:**
   - The application runs on **AWS Cloud**, leveraging its scalability, reliability, and security features.
   - Infrastructure provisioning is automated using **Terraform**, ensuring efficient resource allocation, including networking, security groups, storage, and compute instances.

3. **Automation and Orchestration:**
   - **Ansible:** Automates the deployment process, including installing dependencies, managing Docker containers, and ensuring the seamless connection between application components.
   - **Python (Boto3 and Paramiko):** Used for advanced scripting, such as managing AWS resources programmatically and establishing secure connections to EC2 instances for task execution.

4. **Tools and Technologies:**
   - **Version Control:** GitHub is used for source control and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring collaborative development and version management.
   - **Bash Scripting:** For additional automation tasks and system configurations.
   - **Docker:** Facilitates containerized deployment, making the application portable across environments.

### **Key Features and Accomplishments**
1. **Scalable and Reliable Architecture:**
   - Designed a cloud-based infrastructure with Terraform to dynamically adapt to changing traffic and workload demands.
   - Ensured high availability and fault tolerance by using AWS features such as auto-scaling groups, VPCs, and multi-zone deployments.

2. **Phased Deployment Strategy:**
   - Sequential execution of Node.js and database containers using **Ansible playbooks**, ensuring proper startup order and interconnectivity.
   - Modular automation scripts to minimize downtime during updates and deployments.

3. **Security and Compliance:**
   - Applied AWS best practices for security by configuring secure VPCs, restricted security groups, and encrypted storage.
   - Used GPG keys and Docker image validation for secure deployment.

4. **Efficient Workflow Automation:**
   - Leveraged Python libraries like **Boto3** for resource provisioning and **Paramiko** for SSH automation, reducing manual effort and improving deployment speed.
